RP2paths extracts the set of pathways that lies in a metabolic space file outputed by the RetroPath2.0 workflow. RetroPath2.0 is freely accessible on myExperiment.org at: https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4987.html.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

rp2paths relies on several packages (rdkit, cairo) and binaries (java, graphviz) that can't be installed directly with pip. Please install them before pursuing the rp2paths set up:

```bash
# from a new <myenv> conda environment
conda create --name <myenv> python=3
conda install --yes --channel rdkit rdkit cairo
conda install --yes --channel cyclus java-jre

# system wide installation of graphviz for ubuntu
apt-get install graphviz

# system wide installation of graphviz for mac OS (using homebrew)
brew install graphviz
sudo dot -c

# Or one can try (not tested)
# brew install graphviz --with-bindings --with-freetype --with-librsvg --with-pangocairo
# Reconfigure graphviz if needed:
# sudo dot -c
```


### From pip
```bash
# installation in an already existing <myenv> environment (see prerequisites)
conda activate <myenv>
python -m pip install rp2paths
```

### From conda
```bash
# installation in an already existing <myenv> environment (see prerequisites)
conda activate <myenv>
conda install -c brsynth rp2paths
```

## Usage

### From CLI

Once a scope has been produced by RetroPath2.0, a typical command line for extracting the pathways from the results is

```bash
python -m rp2paths all <retropath2_scope> [--outdir <outdir>]
```

where:
- `all` specify that all the tasks needed for retrieving pathways will be executed at once.
- `<retropath2_scope>` is the metabolic space outputted by the RetroPath2.0 workflow.
- `--outdir <outdir>` specify the directory in which all files will be outputted.

In the `<outdir>` folder, the complete set of pathways enumerated will be written in the `out_paths.csv` file. In addition, for each pathway there will be a .dot file (.dot representation of the graph) and a .svg file (.svg depiction of the pathway).

### Available options

Additional options are described in the embedded help:
```
# List of possible modes 
python -m rp2paths -h

# List of options for the all-in-one mode
python -m rp2paths all -h
```

### Examples

Precomputed results (outputted by RetroPath2.0) are provided in the `examples` folder for few compounds (carotene, naringenin, pinocembrin, violacein).

Below are the command lines for generating pathways that lie in `naringenin` result file:

```bash
source activate <myenv>
python -m rp2paths all examples/naringenin/rp2-results.csv --outdir examples/naringenin/outdir
````


## Test

All modes can be tested with:
```
cd tests
./test-in-docker.sh
```
