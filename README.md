# RP2paths -- RetroPath2.0 to pathways

RP2paths extracts the set of pathways that lies in a metabolic space file outputed by the RetroPath2.0 workflow. RetroPath2.0 is freely accessible on myExperiment.org at: https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4987.html.

## Standalone

### Prerequisites

* Python 3

### Installation
Installation steps are described in the INSTALL file.

### Quick start
The main code is `src/RP2paths.py`. Once a scope has been produced by RetroPath2.0, a typical command line for extracting the pathways from the results is:
```
python src/RP2paths.py all results.csv --outdir pathways
```
where:
- `all` specify that all the tasks needed for retreiving pathways will be executed at once.
- `results.csv` is the metabolic space outputted by the RetroPath2.0 workflow.
- `--outdir pathways` specify the directory in which all files will be outputted (here in `pathways` subfolder).

Additional options are described in the embedded help
```
python src/RP2paths.py -h
python src/RP2paths.py all -h
```

In the output folder (here `pathways`), the complete set of pathways enumerated will be written in the `out_paths.csv` file. In addition, for each pathway there will be a .dot file (.dot representation of the graph) and a .svg file (.svg depiction of the pathway).

### Examples
Precomputed result files (i.e. outputted by RetroPath2.0) are provided in the `examples` folder for few compounds (carotene, naringenin, pinocembrin, violacein).

Below are the command lines for generating pathways that lie in `naringenin` result file:

1. If needed, activate the python environment (here named `pyenv`) that provides all the mandatory python library (see the installation section for details):
```
source activate pyenv
```

2. Retrieve pathways:
```
python src/RP2paths.py all examples/naringenin/rp2-results.csv --outdir examples/naringenin/pathways
```

## Docker

RP2Paths can be run into a docker container.

### Prerequisites

* Docker - [Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Installation
Before running the container, the image has to be built with:
```
cd docker
docker-compose build
```

### Run
Then, the tool is runnable by:
```
cd docker
./RP2paths.sh all <path_to_rp2-results.csv> --outdir <path_to_out_pathways>
```

To call the tool with fresh code:
```
docker-compose run --rm -v <absolutepath_to_src>:/home/src rp2paths
```

To call the tool from any other location:
```
docker run \
    --rm \
    --volume <path_to_rp2-results.csv>:/home/input.csv:ro \
    --volume <path_to_output_folder>:/home/outdir \
    --workdir /home \
    brsynth/rp2paths python src/RP2paths.py all input.csv --outdir outdir
```

## Test
All modes can be tested with:
```
cd test
./test-in-[standalone|docker].sh
```
